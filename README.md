## Installation

There are three ways to install this theme:

2. Use the [starter template][template] (best for GitHub Pages)
3. As a remote theme

#### 1. Gem-based Theme Installation

Replace the contents of your `_config.yml` file with the sample [\_config.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme-starter/master/_config.yml).

```

Or manually.

   gem "jekyll-agency"
   ```
2. Then execute:
   ```sh
   $ bundle install
   ```

#### 2. Using the [Starter Template][template]

This is the fastest and easiest way to get up and running on GitHub Pages.
